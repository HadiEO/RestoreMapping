# RESTORE+ Demonstration of Automated Land Mapping (RDALM)

This repo contains code that walks through key steps to create and validate the RESTORE+ Demonstration of Automated Land Mapping (RDALM), a map that classifies seventeen (17) thematically-detailed land cover classes for the purpose of landscape restoration assessment in Indonesia demonstrated for 2018 at 100m resolution. We used the publicly avalable  satellite data and cloud computing services. (Mention ML).


## Dataset

Our dataset can be accessed through one of two ways:
- Google Earth Engine asset [here]()
- IIASA DARE repo housing GeoTIFFs [here]()

Map legend:
- 0 = Undisturbed dry-land forest
- 1 = Logged-over dry-land forest
- 2 = Undisturbed mangrove
- 3 = Logged-over mangrove
- 4 = Undisturbed swamp forest
- 5 = Logged-over swamp forest
- 6 = Agroforestry
- 7 = Plantation forest
- 8 = Rubber monoculture
- 9 = Oil palm monoculture
- 10 = Other monoculture
- 11 = Grass/savanna
- 12 = Shrub
- 13 = Cropland
- 14 = Settlement
- 15 = Cleared land
- 16 = Waterbody
- 255 =

## Usage Notes

We recommend that users consider metrics such as (1) [user's and producer's accuracy assessed against reference data intepreted by local experts]() and (2) [comparison with available reference map 2010]() across the large country area  to determine which area is of high quality. This can be done with the CSV file of user's and producer's accuracies and ... we have included in this repo.
